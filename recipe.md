time to make our mug cake! follow the steps below:

1. put 2 tbsp flour in your mug
2. add 1 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of cocoa powder
3. also add 1/4 tsp of baking powder
4. MIX WELL UNTIL WELL COMBINED!
5. pour in 1 tbsp of oil into the dry ingredients
6. also pour in 2 tbsp of milk
7. MIX AGAIN UNTIL PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY! (make sure there are NO lumps in the mixture)
8. {optional} if you want sprinkles in your mug cake, now is the time to add them! add as many as your heart desires and mix them all in properly
9. {optional} if you want your mug cake to have some gooey spots with extra warm and sweet nutella, then you should put it in now! you will only need about 1 tbsp. once you put it in the mixture, it's your choice if you want to stir it in or not
10. once you have finished with your batter, put it in the microwave for 1 minute. once it's done, poke a toothpick in the cake to make sure it's fully cooked. if wet batter sticks to the toothpick, that means its not completely cooked yet! keep microwaving it until it's properly cooked
11. your cake is almost done! once it's cooked, carefully take it out of the microwave and let it cool for 3-5 minutes
12. {optional} you are done with your mug cake! however if you want a subtle topping, then use your powdered sugar. use a sifter to coat a layer of powdered sugar onto your mug cake. you can always add even more toppings like berries, whipped cream, or maybe even frosting! anything you want.
